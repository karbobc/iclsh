1. Both Abstract and Full Paper are welcomed. The author can make an oral presentation after the Abstract is accepted and the payment is made.
2. All submitted articles should report original research results, experimental or theoretical, not previously published
   or under consideration for publication elsewhere. Articles submitted to the conference should meet these criteria. We
   firmly believe that ethical conduct is the most essential virtue of any academics. Hence, any act of plagiarism or
   other misconduct is totally unacceptable and cannot be tolerated.
